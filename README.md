 # NanoQuantum Shell Game

In this online version of the classic con game, we demonstrate how to use IBM's quantum computer to solve the riddle of the game by deducing which Shell the ball has been hidden under.

This is a companion to an online [blog article](https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2017/quantum-computing-shell-game-ibm-q/) and a [how-to article](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-quantum-computing-shell-game/). 

You can visit the working version of the shell game at https://nanoquantumshellgame.mybluemix.net/

Please note: in order to use this code you will have to replace the API Token with your own. Create an account on IBM's Q Experience platform and visit the advanced tab of the profile (https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/account/advanced) to generate the API token. Then, in your source code, replace any occurence of "INSERTYOURTOKEN" with a copy of your API Token.
